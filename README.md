# SimpleBlue: A custom Wyam Blog Theme
 
A custom blog theme for [Wyam](http://Wyam.io). The available themes were a bit too modern for my taste, so I created a new one with aesthetics similar to traditional wordpress blogs. [You can see a demo here](https://macn1981.github.io/SimpleBlue_WyamBlogTheme/). 

## Features:

 - **CSS only responsive design:** The blog adapts to different screens, using only CSS.
 - **Minimal JavaScript:** Only a single file (~5kb *un-minified* *un-compressed*) with quality of life enhancements that can be turned off without diminishing the blog usability. 
 - **Dark Mode:** The blog has a toggleable mode for those who prefer web pages with a a dark colour scheme. The setting is stored in local storage. The colour scheme can be further customized by changing the CSS variables at the start of the styles.css file.
 - **Post series:** You can links groups of posts by adding a "Serie" metadata to the post. Posts with the same value in that metadata will have a list of all post in the same series at the starts, with links. Look in the posts folder for examples

## The bad bits:

	- No comments. If you want to add Disqus or any other comment system, you will have to add it yourself.
  - It does not work in Internet Explorer.
